    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul style="text-align: left; font-size: 16px">
        <li>100% responsiveness across all screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience. This involved selectively hiding certain elements on smaller screens.</li><br>
        <li> I have incorporated scroll animations to create a visually appealing and engaging user experience. As visitors scroll through the page, elements come to life with smooth animations.</li><br>
        <li>  The website features a fixed header that remains at the top of the page as you scroll. This allows for easy navigation and access to important sections without having to scroll back to the top.</li><br>
        <li> The contact me section features a contact form with advanced error handling. If a user submits the form with empty or invalid fields, they will receive notifications guiding them to correct the errors before submission.</li><br>
        <li> Visitors who contact me will receive confirmation messages upon successful form submission. This assures them that their message has been received and will be attended to.</li><br>
        <li> I am currently working on adding support for Portuguese and Spanish, please look foward to it.</li><br>

    <h2>Dev's thoughts</h2>
    <p>It's finally here, and I'm thrilled to share it with you! I invite you to explore my portfolio â€“ a result of over 20 hours of hard work, including my own design efforts. If you're interested in collaboration or have suggestions, please don't hesitate to get in touch. I'm deeply grateful to the libraries (<a href='https://www.emailjs.com/'>EmailJS</a>, <a href='https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction'>Toastify</a>, <a href='https://github.com/michalsnik/aos'>react-aos</a>) that significantly eased the development process. I'd like to credit the fantastic illustrations from <a href='https://storyset.com/'>Storyset</a> â€“ they were a real lifesaver. I genuinely hope this portfolio effectively reflects who I am, both as a person and professional.</p>
